/**
 * @brief Method to continuously monitor internet servers and handle exceptions.

 * Monitors the status of internet servers, periodically cleaning logs and resetting exception counters.
 * Handles runtime errors and connection exceptions during server checks and responds accordingly.
 *
 * This method performs the following actions in a continuous loop:
 * - Retrieves the current time using std::chrono::steady_clock.
 * - Checks if the log cleaning interval (CLEAN_PERIOD_IN_SECS) has elapsed since the last log cleaning.
 *   - If true, clears log files using log_clear(), updates the last log cleaning time, and logs the action.
 * - Checks if the connection exceptions cleaning interval (CLEAN_EX_CON_COUNTER_IN_SECS) has elapsed.
 *   - If true, clears exception counters using exceptions_counter_clear(), updates the last cleaning time, and logs the action.
 * - Attempts to check Wi-Fi signal strength using checkSignalStrength().
 *   - Catches std::runtime_error and logs the exception.
 *   - Catches Connection_Exception and handles it using con_exception_treat().
 * - Iterates through each server in the servers list:
 *   - Calls pingServer(server_id) to ping the server and handles exceptions.
 *     - Catches std::runtime_error and logs the exception.
 *     - Catches Connection_Exception and handles it using con_exception_treat(), potentially removing the server.
 *   - If the server has a specified port (not -1), calls check_DNS_and_PORT(server_id).
 *     - Catches Connection_Exception and handles it using con_exception_treat(), potentially removing the server.
 *
 * Servers that are removed during exception handling are skipped in subsequent iterations.
 *
 * @throws std::runtime_error If a runtime error occurs during signal strength checking or server pinging, it is logged.
 * @throws Connection_Exception If a fatal Wi-Fi signal loss or low connectivity is detected during monitoring, appropriate actions are taken.
